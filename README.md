## What is Coinigy?

Coinigy is a fully integrated cryptocurrency trading, analytics, and portfolio management platform designed to simplify and enhance the way traders and investors interact with the digital asset market. It centralizes all major aspects of crypto trading by connecting multiple exchange accounts, wallets, and real-time market data into a single, powerful interface. This eliminates the need to constantly log into separate platforms, making asset management faster, more organized, and more efficient.

The platform supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies and over 40 exchanges, giving users immediate access to global markets from one location. Through secure API integrations, Coinigy allows traders to place spot trades, manage open orders, and track balances without leaving its interface. By streamlining the process of order execution across different platforms, it reduces both time delays and the potential for errors.

One of Coinigy‚Äôs core strengths is its advanced charting and market analysis suite, powered by TradingView. Users can apply dozens of technical indicators, draw trendlines, create multi-chart layouts, and analyze price action with precision. Real-time data feeds ensure that price charts are always up to date, and customizable alerts allow traders to receive notifications for specific price movements, volume spikes, or technical indicator triggers via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.

Beyond active trading, Coinigy serves as a comprehensive portfolio tracking solution. It consolidates data from all connected accounts and wallets, displaying total portfolio value, asset allocation, and performance over time. Historical trade records and transaction history can be exported for in-depth analysis, tax reporting, or record-keeping. These tools are particularly useful for investors managing multiple accounts or those who need accurate performance data for compliance and accounting purposes.

The platform also supports watchlists for monitoring specific coins and markets, as well as news integration to keep traders informed of important developments that could impact prices. Coinigy‚Äôs multi-device synchronization ensures that watchlists, alerts, and open positions remain consistent whether accessed on desktop, web, or mobile. This means that traders can transition between devices seamlessly without losing access to critical information.

Security is a top priority for Coinigy. All exchange connections use encrypted API keys, and user accounts can be secured with two-factor authentication. Coinigy does not hold user funds directly; all trading is executed on connected exchanges, allowing users to retain full control over their assets at all times.

For both active traders and long-term investors, Coinigy provides an environment that blends market access, advanced analytics, and secure asset management. Whether you are day trading, swing trading, or simply monitoring a diversified crypto portfolio, Coinigy delivers a feature-rich, professional-grade solution that keeps you connected to the markets and in control of your trading operations.
